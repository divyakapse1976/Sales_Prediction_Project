Sales Prediction Using Python:- This project predicts product sales based on advertising expenditure across different platforms such as TV, Radio, and Newspaper.

* The goal is to build a machine learning model that can estimate salesbased on marketing investments.

Project Objective:-
To develop a regression-based machine learning model that predicts product sales using historical advertising data and data analysis techniques.

Dataset:-
Source: Advertising Dataset
Features Used:
      TV Advertising Spend
      Radio Advertising Spend
      Newspaper Advertising Spend
      Target Variable:
      Sales
Technologies Used
    Python
    Pandas
    NumPy
    Matplotlib
    Seaborn
    Scikit-learn
    Jupyter Notebook
